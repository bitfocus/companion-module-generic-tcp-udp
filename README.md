# companion-module-generic-tcp-udp

If you are using this plugin,
then it would probably mean that you are using some software that has not been supported yet,
and we would therefore really appreciate if you made a module request for it here:

<https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-requests/issues>

In that way, more people will get to benefit from this in the future, thanks.
